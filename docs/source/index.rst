================================================================================

Casq is an open-source Python toolkit for controlling and analyzing quantum computing processor units based on superconducting qubits.

The goal of Casq is to provide a common interface for different quantum control libraries, such as qiskit-dynamics, qutip-qip/qtrl, c3, and q-ctrl boulder, as well as extending their functionality with respect to pulse optimization and related analysis/visualization.
